## A Late Night Wasp


Hello, I *hope* this works and **welcome**. I was stung by the idea and desire the other night to attempt to create a place where I could post my musings, thoughts, and drivel in one place as opposed to storing them over a cellphone, google drive, and countless notebooks. This is that attempt. I am already in over my head but feeling energized. I don't think I had ever even used the command prompt before today. Well. Time to see if this will post.
