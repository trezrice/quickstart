      <description>A Late Night Wasp Hello, I hope this works and welcome. I was stung by the idea and desire the other night to attempt to create a place where I could post my musings, thoughts, and drivel in one place as opposed to storing them over a cellphone, google drive, and countless notebooks. This is that attempt. I am already in over my head but feeling energized. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had ever even used the command prompt before today.</description>
